First design revision.

My concept was to make a case imitating a laptop for my desktop computer. To keep complexity down I decided to make it fully air cooled, but this very quickly proved to be a terrible idea as it made the computer massive and very loud due to the small fans I had to use.

I designed and printed a custom super flat CPU cooler, and made my own fan shroud for the graphics card (2080ti). I was (and still am) using a HD-PLEX 500 DC - ATX power supply along with a 24v 50A AC-DC power supply.

The computer performed well thermally but there was no way I could make it compact enough for what I was aiming for, so I decided to move onto a water-cooled approach.



Excuse the sloppy pictures as I'm using old ones and I didn't plan on making this public initially.
