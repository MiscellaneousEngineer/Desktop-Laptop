# Desktop-Laptop
The repo for a kind of dumb, kind of smart idea - shoving a watercooled desktop computer into a custom carry case to make a powerful, modular and upgradeable laptop.

I'm currently logging my work with Hackclub as I'm trying to get a grant to make my final version but I'll make a comprehensive project folder here once that is done.
